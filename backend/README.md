# capstone-api

This is our back-end for this project. It is C# dotNET Core, a very popular production hardened framework for API development.

**For this portion of the project, I heavily recommend using Visual Studio. It is free to use.**

For Windows, download Visual Studio Community Edition and launch this portion of the project with it for local development.

For macOS, download Visual Studio for Mac. It is also free to use and will work great for local development.
